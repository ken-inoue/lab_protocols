## Sanger Sequencing

### Summary
These are two suggested alcohol precipitation methods for Sanger sequencing. The first uses **EDTA** while the other uses **EDTA and sodium acetate**. The one that uses EDTA minimizes unincorporated dyes but may cause loss of smallest fragments. The EDTA/NaOAc method will improve recovery of smallest peaks but will also increase the amount of residual unincorporated dyes.

### Reagents and Standards
- 125 mM EDTA
- Molecular grade water
- 100% EtOH

### Method 1: EtOH/EDTA Precipitation in 96-well trays
1. Make a master mix of EtOH/EDTA solution. If your final sequencing volume was 10 µL, then for each sample, add:
- 2.5 µL 125 mM EDTA
- 30 µL 100% EtOH

|Reagents	|Amount (µL)|
|:--------|:-----|
|125 mM EDTA|350 µL|
|100% EtOH|4200 µL|
  
  *If your sequencing volume was 20 µL or you are prepping two plates, double the above reagent volumes

  
2. Add 32.5 µL of EtOH/EDTA solution to 10µL of [cycle sequencing](Cycle_sequencing.md) product
3. Seal wells and briefly vortex
4. Leave at room temperature up to 15 minutes to precipitate extension products *(we skip this step)*
5. Spin in refrigerated centrifuge 2500g for 30 minutes at 4˚C (program #1 on Eppendorf refrigerated centrifuges). Be sure to balance racks and tubes (same number of tubes in each rack--balancing tubes can be empty)
   
**IMPORTANT** Proceed to the next step immediately. If this is not possible, spin the tubes for 2 minutes before the next step.

6. Remove seal and invert tray onto paper towel. Secure 2-3 paper towels over tubes with rubber bands
7. Place tray **inverted** into centrifuge and spin 50 g (up to 185 g) for 3 minutes (program #2 on Eppendorf refrigerated centrifuges)
8. Add 30 µL 70% EtOH to each pellet
    
*ABI recommends making a fresh stock of 70% ethanol each time you do this. For each sample, add*
- 21 µL non-denatured 100% ethanol
- 9 µL molecular grade water

|Reagents	|Amount (µL)|
|:--------|:-----|
|100% EtOH|2940 µL|
|100% molecular grade water|1260 µL|


9. Seal wells and briefly vortex *(we skip this step)*
10. Spin plates 2000-3000 g for 15 minutes at 4˚C (program #3 on Eppendorf refrigerated centrifuges)
11. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to remove 70% EtOH
  
*Optional: Place tubes in 65˚C oven for 10 minutes (our preference) to ensure EtOH evaporates completely **OR** speed vac for 15 minutes **OR** let tubes sit at room temperature for 15 minutes*

12. Samples are ready to be resuspended for 3730 run. They can also be covered in aluminum foil and stored at -20˚C
13. To run on 3730, add 10 µL Hi-Di formamide to each tube
14. Add samples and computer file and run on 3730

### Method 2: Use the exact same protocol as above except steps 1 and 2 are as follows
1. Make a master mix of EtOH/EDTA solution. If your final sequencing volume was 10 µL, then for each sample, add:
- 1 µL 125 mM EDTA
- 1 µL 3M NaOAc
- 25 µL 100% EtOH
  
  *If your sequencing volume was 20 µL, double the volumes above
2. Add 27 µL of EtOH/EDTA solution to 10 µL of cycle sequencing product
  
*Additionally, this protocol calls for 35 µL of 70% ethanol vs 30 µL as in **Method 1***
