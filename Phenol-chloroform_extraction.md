# DNA Extraction

## Phenol/chroloform extraction

### SUMMARY
This is a procedure for Phenol/Chloroform extraction. This protocol is designed for general whole genomic DNA extraction from ethanol preserved tissue samples. You may need to optimize and modify this protocol for your study. Yields DNA suitable for PCR. Protocol requires overnight incubation.

### EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Water bath
- Fume hood
- Centrifuge
- Vortex
- Pipettes
- Pipette tips
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.7 mL)
- Freezer

### REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
- [Lysis buffer](reagent_and_buffers.md)
- Proteinase K (20 mg/mL)
- Phenol (refrigerator)
- Mix of phenol/chloroform/isomyl alcohol (25:24:1) (refrigerator)
- Chloroform
- Isopropanol (freezer)
- 70% ethanol (freezer)

### SAMPLE PREPARATION AND STORAGE
Tissue may be stored in 100-95% ethanol or frozen. Formalin preserved material is not suitable for this method. 

### EQUIPMENT PREPARATION
See “Procedure”.

### PROCEDURE
1. Turn on water bath to 65°C to begin heating for use in later step.
2. Label 4 sets of microcentrifuge tubes for each sample appropriately.
3. Dissect a piece of tissue from the specimen (mantle tissue for mussels, head or mantle tissue for gastropod, appendages for amphipod and insects) approximately the size of a small match head and place into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 250µL lysis buffer and 5 µL proteinase K.
5. Incubate at 55°C for at least 3 hours to overnight in water bath.
6. Add 250µL phenol and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds.
7. Centrifuge at 10,000 rcf for 5 minutes.
8. Move the supernatant (top, clear layer only) into a new (labeled) microcentrifuge tube using a pipette. (Discard the bottom layers in chemical wastes)
9. Add 250µL phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds.
10. Repeat Step 7 and 8.
11. Add 250µL chloroform and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds.
12. Repeat Step 7 and 8.
13. Precipitate DNA by adding 550µL isopropanol (ice cold), vortex gently, and place in -20°C freezer overnight.
14. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>16,000 rcf) for 30 minutes.
15. Discard the upper isopropanol layer (To do this: generally, a small pellet has formed at the bottom of the tube [NOT ALWAYS VISIBLE]. Gently tip the tube and pour off the ethanol, being careful not to let the pellet fall out of the tube. Sometimes they make it easy on you and stick to the side, but sometimes you need to be more careful.)
16. Add 500µL of ice cold 70% ethanol and briefly vortex.
17. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>16,000 rcf) for 30 minutes
18. Discard the upper layer (70% ethanol). (Same fashion as step 13).
19. Invert the microcentrifuge tube on a paper towel and let the DNA pellet air dry for 30 minutes (until residual ethanol evaporates. DO NOT OVER DRY).
20. Resuspend the DNA pellet in molecular grade water (50µl) and incubate at 55°C for 1 hour.
21. Qualify the DNA via [agarose gel electrophoresis](gel_electrophoresis.md)
22. Store DNA in freezer.

### CLEAN UP
Place phenol/chloroform wastes into the liquid waste in fume hood.  

### DATA ANALYSIS AND CALCULATIONS
See protocol for [agarose gel electrophoresis](gel_electrophoresis.md) and spectrophotometer.

### NOTES
Use phenol/chloroform in fume hood. Do not inhale phenol/chloroform.
