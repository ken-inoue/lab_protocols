## Nanopore Online Learning
The following resources are taken from Oxford Nanopore Technologies [online portal](https://id.customers.nanoporetech.com/app/nanoporetech-customers_community_1/exk2kkqokrHG49IhQ697/sso/saml?RelayState=https://community.nanoporetech.com/). The portal contains updates on new technologies and protocols, chat forums, online courses and lessons for community members that can be accessed at any time. The online learning modules listed below are extremely helpful for anyone who is learning to use Nanopore for the first time.

- [ONTBarcoder](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder)
#### Videos
- [MinION Introduction](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/unboxing-minion-introduction): Introduces the MinION device and all its component parts.
- [Library preparation: Ligation sequencing kit](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/sqk-lsk109-library-prep): Provides an overview of the ligation sequencing kit workflows. *Note: When using Flongle Flow Cells, most amounts and volumes referenced in this video will be halved.*
- [Priming and loading your flow cell](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/priming-and-loading-your-flow-cell): Provides a comprehensive overview and demonstration of priming and loading a flow cell. *Note: This video uses a MinION flow cell. To see a demonstration of how to prime and load a Flongle Flow Cell, click [here](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/priming-and-loading-a-flongle-flow-cell).*
- [Introduction: Real-time analysis](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/real-time-analysis): Provides an overview of MinKNOW program and real-time basecalling and analysis during sequencing.
#### Online courses
- [Introduction to Nanopore Sequencing](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/courses/introduction-to-nanopore-sequencing): Provides an overview of Nanopore sequencing and allows new users to gain an understanding of how the technology works and common workflows.
- [Control Experiment: Ligation sequencing guide](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/courses/control-experiment-ligation-sequencing-guide/lessons/sqk-lsk109-library-prep): Provides guidance for running a control experiment using the Ligation Sequencing Kit. This course is tailored towards experiments run on the MinION, but we primarily use Flongle. Keep in mind that most volumes mentioned in this guide will be halved in the Flongle Flow Cell protocols.
- [Introduction to data analysis](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/courses/introduction-to-data-analysis): Provides an overview of bioinformatics resources provided by Oxford Nanopore for use with data analysis. It also includes examples of how to format generated data files for analysis with these programs.
#### Step-by-step protocols
- [Ligation sequencing DNA V14 (SQK-LSK114)](https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/genomic-dna-by-ligation-sqk-lsk114/v/gde_9161_v114_revu_29jun2022): A step-by step protocol for DNA repair and end-prep, adapter ligation and clean-up, and priming and loading the Flow Cell. ***To access this protocol for Flongle Flow Cells, 1) click the link, 2) navigate to the drop-down menu on the right side of the page in the yellow box
 and select "Flongle", 3) click "Go", and 4) navigate to the top of the page and click the green button that says "Start protocol".***
- [Starting a sequencing run on MinION Mk1B](https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/experiment-companion-minknow/v/mke_1013_v1_revdc_11apr2016/starting-a-sequencing-run-on-minion): Step-by-step instructions on how to set up parameters on MinKNOW software before starting a sequencing run. Also includes details of how to stop a sequencing run and retrieve generated data files. ***Note: Select "FLO-FLG114" under the "Flow cell type" drop-down menu when using Flongle Flow Cells. Select "Ligation Sequencing Kit SQK-LSK114" under the "Kit selection" tab.***
