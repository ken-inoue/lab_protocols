## Nanopore Online Learning
The following resources are taken from Oxford Nanopore Technologies [online portal](https://id.customers.nanoporetech.com/app/nanoporetech-customers_community_1/exk2kkqokrHG49IhQ697/sso/saml?RelayState=https://community.nanoporetech.com/). The portal contains updates on new technologies and protocols, chat forums, online courses and lessons for community members that can be accessed at any time. The online learning modules listed below are extremely helpful for anyone who is learning to use Nanopore for the first time.

#### Videos
- [MinION Introduction](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/unboxing-minion-introduction): Introduces the MinION device and all its component parts.
- [Library preparation: Ligation sequencing kit](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/sqk-lsk109-library-prep): Provides an overview of the ligation sequencing kit workflows. *Note: When using Flongle Flow Cells, most amounts and volumes referenced in this video will be halved.*
- [Priming and loading your flow cell](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/priming-and-loading-your-flow-cell): Provides a comprehensive overview and demonstration of priming and loading a flow cell. *Note: This video uses a MinION flow cell. To see a demonstration of how to prime and load a Flongle Flow Cell, click [here](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/priming-and-loading-a-flongle-flow-cell).*
- [Introduction: Real-time analysis](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/lessons/real-time-analysis): Provides an overview of MinKNOW program and real-time basecalling and analysis during sequencing.
#### Online courses
- [Introduction to Nanopore Sequencing](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/courses/introduction-to-nanopore-sequencing): Provides an overview of Nanopore sequencing and allows new users to gain an understanding of how the technology works and common workflows.
- [Control Experiment: Ligation sequencing guide](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/courses/control-experiment-ligation-sequencing-guide/lessons/sqk-lsk109-library-prep): Provides guidance for running a control experiment using the Ligation Sequencing Kit. This course is tailored towards experiments run on the MinION, but we primarily use Flongle. Keep in mind that most volumes mentioned in this guide will be halved in the Flongle Flow Cell protocols.
- [Introduction to Data Analysis](https://community.nanoporetech.com/nanopore_learning/courses/introduction-to-data-analysis): Provides an overview of bioinformatics resources provided by Oxford Nanopore for use with data analysis. It also includes examples of how to format generated data files for analysis with these programs.
