## Electrophoresis

### Summary
This is a procedure for visualizing DNA via agarose gel electrophoresis. This protocol can be used to qualify raw DNA and amplified DNA via PCR.

### Equipment & Supplies
- 250 mL media bottle or Erlenmeyer flask
- Graduated cylinder
- Pipettes 
- Weigh boat or paper
- Spatula
- Scale
- Microwave
- Electrophoresis system (gel tray, combs, and gel rig)
- Power supply device
- Blue LED Transilluminator

### Reagents & Standards
- Agarose (low electroendosmosis grade)
- 1x TAE buffer
- Midori Green Xtra (or similar DNA stains that illuminate under blue LED)
- 6x Loading dye
- DNA ladder
- Parafilm

### Sample Preparation & Storage
Samples can be raw extracted DNA and PCR products.

### Equipment Preparation
See “Procedure” section.

### Procedure

#### Agarose Gel Preparation
1. Make 100 mL of 1.5% agarose gel (1.5 g agarose in 100 mL 1x TAE buffer) in a media bottle.
2. Heat agarose-TAE solution in the microwave until agarose dissolved (1 - 1.5 minutes). 
   a. Securely close the lid. 
   b. Heat in 1-minute increments. 
   c. Release any pressure built in the media bottle by slowly opening the lid. CAUTION: The bottle will be very hot. Use heat-resistance gloves. The pressure may be high, so open the lid slowly and carefully.
3. Allow the solution to cool to around 60 °C, so you can hold your hand against the side for several seconds to prevent warping of the gel rig from high heat. 
4. Add 4 µL of Midori Green Xtra into the solution and mix thoroughly.
5. Pour the solution into gel rig to a depth of 5 mm and place the combs in position on the gel rig.
6. Allow the gel to solidify for 15–20 minutes.

#### Run DNA on Gel
7. Place the gel into electrophoresis chamber.
8. Fill chamber with 1x TAE buffer to cover the top of the gel.
9. Prepare samples by mixing 5 µL of the sample with 1 µL of the loading dye solution on a small piece of parafilm.
10. Load the samples into gel. (Leave the first well of each comb for the DNA ladder.)
11. Add 4 µL of DNA ladder into the first well.
12. Run gel at 90 volt until dye has reached to the edge of the gel (around 30 min).

### CLEAN UP
Gel can be reused for few times. Add 2–4 µL Midori Green Xtra if necessary. Old gel can be tossed in a trash can.

### DATA ANALYSIS AND CALCULATION
None.

### NOTES
Feel free to make necessary modifications according to your specific experiment.
