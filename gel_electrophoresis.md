# DNA Quality Assessment

## Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

### SUMMARY
This is a procedure for visualizing DNA via agarose gel electrophoresis. This protocol can be used to qualify raw DNA and amplified DNA via PCR and extraction of PCR products.

### EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- 250 mL media bottle or Erlenmeyer flask
- Graduated cylinder
- Pipettes 
- Weigh boat or paper
- Spatula
- Scale
- Microwave
- Electrophoresis system (gel tray, combs, and gel rig)
- Power supply device
- Transilluminator

### REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
- Agarose (low electroendosmosis grade)
- 1x TAE buffer
- MidoriDirect (or similar DNA stains that illuminate under blue LED)
- 6x Loading dye
- DNA ladder
- Parafilm

### SAMPLE PREPARATION AND STORAGE
Samples can be raw extracted DNA and PCR products

### EQUIPMENT PREPARATION
See “Procedure”.

### PROCEDURE
1. Make 200 mL 1.5% agarose gel (i.e., 3 g agarose in 200 mL 1x TAE buffer) in media bottle.
2. Heat agarose-TAE mixture in microwave until agarose dissolved (1.5 - 2 minutes). 
   a. Tightly close a lid. 
   b. Heat with 1-minute increment. 
   c. Release pressure built in the media bottle by opening the lid slowly. CAUTION: bottle is very hot. Use heat resistance gloves. Pressure may be high. Open the lid slowly and carefully.
3. Let gel cool down to around 60 °C.
4. Place gel tray on a gel tray holder and place gel combs.
5. Slowly pour gel into gel tray and let solidify.

### CLEAN UP
Gel can be reused for few times. Old gel can be tossed in a trash can.

### DATA ANALYSIS AND CALCULATION
None.
