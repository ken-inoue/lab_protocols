## PCR

### Summary
This is a procedure for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This protocol was designed specifically for Sanger sequencing and microsatellite genotyping via fragment analysis. Each study will require fine tuning of this protocol as PCR protocols may not transfer well from one study to another. This protocol provides a starting point but may need modifications (see PCR optimization procedure and troubleshooting).

### Equipment & Supplies
Vortex
Pipettes
Pipette tips
Microcentrifuge tubes
PCR tubes
Table-top spinner
Thermal cycler

### Reagents & Standards
Template DNA (~10 ng/µL)
Taq Master Mix (GoTaq Master Mix, Promega)
Forward & reverse primers
Tagged primer
Molecular-grade H2O

###S ample Preparation & Storage
All reagents should be kept frozen until you are ready to use. Repeated freezing and thawing will kill Taq and primers. The other materials may be thawed and allowed to set out during preparation.

### Procedure
To minimize pipette error and chances of contamination, you will first make a master mix solution depending on how many samples you are running plus 2 (one for a negative control and one to account for pipetting error). This master mix solution is then put into each tube so that you are not putting in each reagent into each tube separately.

#### PCR for Genotyping via Fragment Analysis
1. Thaw all reagents and keep them on ice. Briefly vortex and spin to collect the material at the bottom of the tubes.
2. Make the following PCR reaction mix solution on ice.
The followings are an example for 96 samples in 10-µL reaction volumes. These volumes are to be deposited into the first column of wells on a 96-sample plate. 9µL of the master mix is then distributed across the remaining 11 columns of the plate using a multichannel pipette.

For 10-µL reaction volume*:
|Reagents	|Amount| Final concentration| Number of samples | Total volume|
|:--------|:-----|:-------------------|:------------------|:------------|
|GoTaq Master Mix	|65 µL| 1X| | 200 µL|
|Tagged Primer |3.25 µL| 
|Forward primer (10 µM)	|0.65 µL| 0.1 – 1.0 µM| | 20 µL|
|Reverse primer	(10 µM) |3.25 µL| 0.1 – 1.0 µM| x 20| 20 µL|
|Molecular grade H2O	|44.85 (45) µL| N.A.| |  120 µL|

Reagents	Amount	Final concentration in each well
Taq Master Mix	5 µL	1X
Tagged Primer 0.25 µL
Forward primer (10 µM)	0.05 µL	0.1 – 1.0 µM
Reverse primer (10 µM)	0.25 µL	0.1 – 1.0 µM
Molecular grade H2O	3.45 µL	N.A.
DNA template (10 ng/µL)	1 µL	<250 ng
*Make enough for # of samples plus 1 extra (for pipetting error). The above table will make PCR mix solution for 13 samples even though there are only 12 columns to account for pipetting error during master mix distribution using a multichannel pipette.

3. Aliquot 1µL DNA into each well of the plate, placing the samples on the wall of each well. Run one sample without DNA, only master mix. Label this tube as X or NC for negative control. (If you get amplification in the negative control, something has been contaminated).
4. Remove any bubbles by spinning in plate centrifuge. If this does not work, try popping bubbles with a small pipette tip.
5. Cover the plate and place it into the thermal cycler and run program. (Program will vary with project and gene being amplified).
  Basic thermal cycle: Initial denaturing at 95˚C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles with denature at 95˚C for 30 s, annealing at 52-55˚C for 30 s, extension at 72˚C for 1 min, and final extension at 72˚C for 10 min.
