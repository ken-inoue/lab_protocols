# General Lab Preparation

## Always Keep Lab Clean
Keeping lab clean is substantial. Avoid contamination of lab equipment, reagents, and chemicals.

Use 10% bleach to wipe lab bench and 70% ethanol to sterilize.

## Filling Pipette Tips and Tubes
If you see empty pipette tip boxes, fill with bulk pipette tips. We regularly use three kinds of pipette tips: white tips for 200–1000 µL, yellow tips for 5–200 µL, and white tips for 0.5–10 µL.

Fill 1 L beaker with microcentrifuge tubes (1.7 mL) and 500 µL with PCR tubes (0.2 mL) and PCR tube lids. Cover the beakers with a piece of aluminum foil.

Put autoclave tape on the tip box and aluminum foil, and proceed to autoclaving.
