## CTAB/Chroloform Extraction

### Summary
This is a procedure for CTAB/Chloroform extraction. This protocol is designed for whole genomic DNA extraction from ethanol-preserved tissue and swab samples. You may need to optimize and modify this protocol for your study. It yields DNA suitable for PCR and sequencing. Protocol requires overnight incubation

### Equipment & Supplies
- Water bath (or heat block)
- Fume hood
- Centrifuge
- Vortex
- Pipettes
- Pipette tips
- Microcentrifuge tubes
- Freezer

### Reagents & Standards
- [2x CTAB buffer](reagent_and_buffers.md#2x-ctab)
- Proteinase K (20 mg/mL)
- Chloroform (Fume hood)
- Isopropanol (-20°C freezer)
- 70% ethanol (-20°C freezer)

### Sample Preparation & Storage
Tissues may be stored in 100-95% ethanol or frozen. Formalin preserved material is not suitable for this method.

### Equipment Preparation
See “Procedure” section.

### Procedure

#### Preparation
1. Turn on the water bath and set it to 65°C for heating in a later step.
2. Appropriately label 2 sets of microcentrifuge tubes for each sample.

#### Lysis
3. Dissect a piece of tissue from the specimen or place a swab sample into a microcentrifuge tube.
 - For tissue samples, cut a mantle tissue to the size of a small match head (2 x 2 mm).
 - For swab samples, remove excess ethanol from the swabs by rubbing it against the tube walls before placing into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 700 µL of 2x CTAB buffer.
5. Incubate at 65°C for one hour in the water bath.
6. Remove tubes from the water bath and add 5 µL of proteinase K solution.
7. Incubate at 65°C for at least 3 hours to overnight in the water bath.

#### Isolation
8. Remove tubes from the water bath and cool to room temperature.
 - For the swab samples, remove swabs from the tubes and discard them. 
9. Add 700 µL of chloroform and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds.
10. Centrifuge at 11,000 rcf for 5 minutes.
11. Transfer the supernatant (top, clear layer only) into a new (labeled) microcentrifuge tube using a pipette. (Discard the bottom layers in chemical wastes.)
12. Precipitate DNA by adding 700 µL of ice-cold isopropanol, vortex for 10 seconds, and place in a -20°C freezer overnight.

#### Precipitation
13. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>16,000 rcf) for 30 minutes.
14. Discard the liquid layer.
 - Generally, a small pellet is fomred at the bottom of the tube (however, not always visible). Gently tip the tube and pour off the liquid layer into an empty beaker, being careful not to let the pellet fall out of the tube.
 - Occasionally, two layers of liquid are formed instead of a small pellet. Discard the supernatant using a pipette, leaving the cloudier layer in the tube.
15. Add 200 µL of ice-cold 70% ethanol and briefly vortex.
16. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>16,000 rcf) for 30 minutes
17. Discard the liquid layer (70% ethanol). (Same fashion as step 14).
18. Invert the microcentrifuge tube on a paper towel and let the DNA pellet air-dry, generally at least 1 hour, until residual ethanol evaporates. DO NOT OVER DRY.
19. Resuspend the DNA pellet in molecular-grade water (50 µl) and incubate at 55°C for 1 hour.
20. Briefly vortex and spin down; store DNA in freezer.

### Clean Up
Place chloroform wastes into the liquid waste in fume hood. 

### Data Analysis and Calculation
See protocol for [agarose gel electrophoresis](gel_electrophoresis.md) and [Qubit](Qubit.md).

### NOTES
Prepare 2x CTAB in fume hood. Do not inhale chloroform.
