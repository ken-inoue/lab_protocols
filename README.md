# Protocols
## Lab protocols for the Freshwater Mussel Lab

This is a general DNA/RNA lab manual from how to make reagents to DNA sequencing, microsatellite genotyping via fragment analysis, and quantifying gene expression via qPCR. This manual provides a starting point and may need optimization and modification for your study. Each study will require fine-tuning of the manual.
