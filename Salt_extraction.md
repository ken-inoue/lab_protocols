## Salt Extraction

### Summary
This is a protocol for a salt extraction (Ajianabi & Martinez, 1997). This protocol is designed for whole genomic DNA extraction from ethanol-preserved tissue and swab samples. You may need to optimize and modify this protocol for your study. It yields DNA suitable for PCR and sequencing. Protocol requires overnight incubation.

### Equipment & Supplies
- Water bath (or heat block)
- Centrifuge
- Vortex
- Pipettes
- Pipette tips
- Microcentrifuge tubes
- Freezer

### Reagents & Standards
- [Salt homogenizing buffer](reagent_and_buffers.md#salt)
- Proteinase K (20 mg/mL)
- 6M NaCl
- Isopropanol (-20°C freezer)
- 70% ethanol (-20°C freezer)

### Sample Preparation & Storage
Tissues may be stored in 100-95% ethanol or frozen. Formalin preserved material is not suitable for this method.

### Equipment Preparation
See “Procedure” section.

### Procedure

#### Preparation
1. Turn on the water bath and set it to 55–65°C for heating in a later step.
2. Appropriately label 2 sets of microcentrifuge tubes for each sample.

#### Lysis
3. Dissect a piece of tissue from the specimen or place a swab sample into a microcentrifuge tube.
 - For tissue samples, cut a mantle tissue to the size of a small match head (2 x 2 mm).
 - For swab samples, remove excess ethanol from the swabs by rubbing it against the tube walls before placing into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 400 µL of salt homogenezing buffer.
5. Add 5 µL of proteinase K solution.
6. Incubate at 65°C for at least 3 hours or overnight in the water bath.

#### Isolation
7. Remove tubes from the water bath and cool to room temperature.
 - For the swab samples, remove swabs from the tubes and discard them. 
8. Add 300 µL of 6M NaCl solution and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds.
9. Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 10,000 g.
10. Transfer the supernatant (top, clear layer only) into a new (labeled) microcentrifuge tube using a pipette.
11. Add equal valume of ice-cold isopropanol (700 µL), vortex for 10 seconds, and place in a -20°C for 1 hour.

#### Precipitation
12. Centrifuge for 20 min at maximum speed (>16,000 g).
13. Discard the liquid layer.
 - Generally, a small pellet is fomred at the bottom of the tube (however, not always visible). Gently tip the tube and pour off the liquid layer into an empty beaker, being careful not to let the pellet fall out of the tube.
 - Occasionally, two layers of liquid are formed instead of a small pellet. Discard the supernatant using a pipette.
14. Add 200 µL of ice-cold 70% ethanol and briefly vortex.
15. Centrifuge for 20 min at maximum speed (>16,000 g).
16. Discard the liquid layer (70% ethanol). (Same fashion as step 14).
17. Invert the microcentrifuge tube on a paper towel and let the DNA pellet air-dry for 30 minutes (until residual ethanol evaporates. DO NOT OVER DRY).
18. Resuspend the DNA pellet in molecular-grade water (50 µl) and incubate at 55°C for 1 hour.
19. Briefly vortex and spin down; store DNA in freezer.

### Clean Up
Place chloroform wastes into the liquid waste in fume hood.
