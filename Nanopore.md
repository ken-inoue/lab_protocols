## Library Prep and Sequencing for Nanopore

### Summary
This is a procedure for library prep and sequencing after [PCR product pooling and cleanup for Nanopore](Nanopore_Product_Pooling.md). This procedure is adapted from the [ligation sequencing Kit V14](https://github.com/ken-inoue/lab_protocols/files/14776449/Ligation_Sequencing.pdf), [Srivathsan et. al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-01141-x), and [ligation sequencing DNA V14 (SQK-LSK114)](https://github.com/ken-inoue/lab_protocols/files/14776483/genomic-dna-by-ligation-sqk-lsk114-GDE_9161_v114_revU_29Jun2022-minion.pdf) protocols. This procedure is volume adjusted for Flongle Flow Cells but may need modification for use with MinION Flow Cells or other Nanopore sequencing devices.
