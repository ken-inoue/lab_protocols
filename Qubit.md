### Procedure 


#### Calibration of the Qubit Fluorometer
5. On the home screen of the Qubit Fluorometer, press **DNA**, then select **dsDNA High Sensitivity** as the assay type. The "Read Standards" screen is displayed. Press **Read Standards** to proceed. *Note: If using a previous calibration of Qubit, press **Run samples** on the "Read Standards" screen. Skip Steps 5-7 and proceed with Step 8.*
6. Insert the tube containing Standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read standard**. When reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove Standard #1.
7. Insert the tube containing Standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read standard**. When reading is complete, (~3 seconds), remove Standard #2.


The instrument displays the results on the "Read standards" screen. For information on how to interpret calibration results, refer to the [Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer User Guide](https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/qubit_3_fluorometer_man.pdf).
#### Qubit High Sensitivity Assay for DNA Quantitation
8. Press **Run Samples**.
9. On the assay screen, select the sample volume and units:
    - Press the + or - buttons on the wheel to select the sample volume added to the assay tube (from 1-20 µL).
    - From the dropdown menu, select the units for the output sample concentration (standard choice is ng/µL).
10. Insert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read tube**. When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the tube.
The instrument displays the results on the assay screen. The top value (in large font) is the concentration of the original sample. The bottom value is the diluted concentration. Repeat step until all samples have been run.
11. Export sample results in a table format by pressing the **Export** at the bottom of the assay screen.
### Clean up
Working and standard tubes can be disgarded after being read through the Qubit Fluorometer.
