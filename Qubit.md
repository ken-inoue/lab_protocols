## Qubit

### Summary
switch to broad range sensitivity if not using hs reagents
### Equipment and Supplies
- 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
- Vortex
- Pipettes
- Pipette tips
### Reagents and Standards
- sample DNA for quantification
- Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent
- Qubit dsDNA HS Buffer
- Qubit dsDNA HS Standard #1
- Qubit dsDNA HS Standard #2
### Sample Preparation and Storage
The Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent and Buffer are designed for room temperature storage. Store the DNA standards at 4°C.
### Procedure 
1. Prepare the Qubit working dilution. Add the below volumes of Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent and Buffer into a clean tube and vortex. *Note: 180-199 µL of Qubit working dilution will be added to each sample tube with sample DNA. Be sure to make enough working dilution for all samples being assayed. Do not label the sides of sample tubes, as it could interfere with the sample read.*
   
|Reagents|Amount for a 1:200 dilution|Concentration|
|:--------|:-----|:-------------------|
|Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent|1 µL|200X in DSMO|
|Qubit dsDNA HS Buffer|199 µL|NA|
2. Prepare the Qubit calibration standards in two clean, labeled 0.5 mL tubes. Add 200 uL of dsDNA HS Standard #s 1 and 2 to their respective tubes and vortex. *Note: Do not label the sides of the tubes. This could interfere with the sample read.*

|Reagents|Amount|Concentration|
|:--------|:-----|:-------------------|
|Qubit dsDNA HS Standard #1|200 µL|0 ng/µL in TE Buffer|
|Qubit dsDNA HS Standard #2|200 µL|10 ng/µL in TE Buffer|

3. Add the Qubit working solution and sample DNA to clean 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The volume in each working tube must add up to 200 µL. *Note: DNA volume can be between 1-20 µL. Qubit working solution should be added to the chosen volume of DNA to add up to 200 µL. For example, if using 5 µL of DNA in a working tube, add 195 µL of Qubit working solution.*
#### Calibration of the Qubit Fluorometer
5. On the home screen of the Qubit Fluorometer, press **DNA**, then select **dsDNA High Sensitivity** as the assay type. The "Read Standards" screen is displayed. Press **Read Standards** to proceed. *Note: If using a previous calibration of Qubit, press **Run samples** on the "Read Standards" screen. Skip Steps 5-7 and proceed with Step 8.*
6. Insert the tube containing Standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read standard**. When reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove Standard #1.
7. Insert the tube containing Standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read standard**. When reading is complete, (~3 seconds), remove Standard #2.


The instrument displays the results on the "Read standards" screen. For information on how to interpret calibration results, refer to the [Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer User Guide](https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/qubit_3_fluorometer_man.pdf).
#### Qubit High Sensitivity Assay for DNA Quantitation
8. Press **Run Samples**.
9. On the assay screen, select the sample volume and units:
    - Press the + or - buttons on the wheel to select the sample volume added to the assay tube (from 1-20 µL).
    - From the dropdown menu, select the units for the output sample concentration (standard choice is ng/µL).
10. Insert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read tube**. When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the tube.


The instrument displays the results on the assay screen. The top value (in large font) is the concentration of the original sample. The bottom value is the diluted concentration. Repeat step until all samples have been run.

11. Export sample results in a table format by pressing the **Export** at the bottom of the assay screen.
### Clean up
Working and standard tubes can be disgarded after being read through the Qubit Fluorometer.
